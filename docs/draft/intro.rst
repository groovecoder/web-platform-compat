API (DRAFT)
===========

**This is a draft document**

The `MDN community`_ maintains information about web technologies such as HTML
and CSS.  This includes information about which specifications define the
technology, and what browsers support the technology.

Browser support is shown in **Browser compatibility** tables in the source.  A
simple example is for the `HTML element \<address\>`_.  A more complex example
is the `CSS property display`_.

There are several issues with the table-based compatibility tables, some of
which could be solved by having a database-backed representation of
compatibilty data, readable and writable from an API.
